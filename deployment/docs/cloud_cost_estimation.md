## Cost Optimization Recommendations

### AWS Cost Optimization
1. **Reserved Instances**: Purchase reserved instances for ECS to reduce compute costs by up to 40%
2. **S3 Intelligent Tiering**: Use for file storage to automatically move infrequently accessed files to cheaper storage tiers
3. **CloudFront Caching**: Optimize cache settings to reduce origin requests

### GCP Cost Optimization
1. **Committed Use Discounts**: Purchase committed use contracts for Cloud Run to save up to 40%
2. **Cloud CDN**: Implement proper caching to reduce data transfer costs
3. **Cloud Storage Lifecycle Policies**: Automatically transition older files to Nearline or Coldline storage

### Azure Cost Optimization
1. **Reserved Instances**: Purchase reserved instances for Container Apps to reduce compute costs
2. **Azure CDN**: Implement proper caching to reduce data transfer costs
3. **Blob Storage Access Tiers**: Use Cool or Archive access tiers for infrequently accessed files

## Scaling Considerations

As the platform grows, costs will scale primarily with:

1. **Backend Compute**: Scales with user traffic and API requests
2. **Database**: Scales with data volume and transaction throughput
3. **Bandwidth**: Scales with user activity and file transfers

For a platform with 25,000 monthly active users (5x growth), estimated costs would be:

- **AWS**: $450-550/month
- **GCP**: $480-580/month
- **Azure**: $500-600/month

## Recommendation

Based on cost analysis and feature comparison:

- **For startups prioritizing cost efficiency**: AWS offers the lowest initial cost with good scalability
- **For teams already using Google ecosystem**: GCP provides good integration with other Google services
- **For enterprises with existing Microsoft licenses**: Azure offers integration benefits with Microsoft products

The final choice should consider not only cost but also team expertise, existing infrastructure, compliance requirements, and specific feature needs.

## Introduction

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for migrating the Lexova platform from free hosting to scalable paid hosting solutions. The migration process is designed to ensure minimal downtime, data integrity, and optimal performance in the new environment.

### Platform Components

The Lexova platform consists of the following components:

1. **Frontend**: React-based web application
2. **Backend API**: Flask-based RESTful API
3. **Database**: MongoDB for data storage
4. **AI Services**: OpenAI integration for lawyer matching and case analysis
5. **File Storage**: For document management and user uploads
6. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system

### Migration Goals

- Establish a scalable infrastructure that can handle growing user traffic
- Implement robust security measures for sensitive legal data
- Set up automated deployment pipelines for continuous delivery
- Configure monitoring and alerting for system health
- Optimize performance and reduce latency
- Ensure compliance with legal data regulations

## Architecture Overview

### Current Architecture (Free Hosting)

The current architecture uses free hosting services with limited scalability:

- Frontend: Deployed on a static site hosting service
- Backend: Deployed on a free-tier PaaS with limited resources
- Database: Local MongoDB instance with limited storage
- File Storage: Local file system with limited capacity
- No dedicated CI/CD pipeline
- Limited monitoring capabilities

### Target Architecture (Paid Hosting)

The target architecture leverages cloud services for scalability and reliability:

- Frontend: Deployed on CDN-backed hosting with global distribution
- Backend: Containerized API deployed on managed Kubernetes or serverless platform
- Database: Managed MongoDB service with automatic scaling and backups
- File Storage: Cloud object storage with access controls
